# ML Simulator

Built During Hack-A-BIT 2.0

IDEA ABSTRACT: A machineLearning playground/simulator where one can analyze different
datasets graphically and statistically and apply various
classification and regression models. It will be capable of
determining the best suitable algorithm for any case and applying it.
One may also select the preferred algorithm for predictions and
compare the efficiencies of different algorithms.
Theidea is simple, you have a dataset but don't have knowledge about
models, also doesn't care how to do the stuff but is only concerned
about the results. Don't worry we have got the solution, upload your
models and we will run through our black box formula and give you the
best of the results which would take hours of human efforts.

Tech Stack:
ReactJs(Frontend), Flask (Backend), Python Libraries (SKlearn, Pandas,
Numpy, NLTK,Spacy), GIT
